# 14. Longest Collatz Sequence
===============

What number under One Million generates the longest hailstone sequence?

A Collatz squence is generated by taking a seed number and iterating it through:
 * if n is even, divide it by 2
 * else multiply n by 3 and add 1
until it the result of the permutations is 1.

My solution is straightoward. It gets a two speed boosts: 

First, it momoizes the length of each sequence and if at any point in calculating another sequence it hits that number, it simply tacks on the lenght of the known sequence to the progress of the current one.  For caluclating the longest sequence for every number under 1,000,000 it makes use of memos over a hundred thousand times (the solution takes 635ms on my laptop).

Second, if the current number in the sequence being calculated is a power of 2, it calculates the remaining sequence by determining its power of 2 (any power of 2 will thenceforth satify the `if even` condition, and the sequence will reduce straight to 1, over exactly x iterations where n = 2^x)
