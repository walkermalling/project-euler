# 14. Longest Collatz Sequence
===============

What number under One Million generates the longest hailstone sequence?

A Collatz squence is generated by taking a seed number and iterating it through:
 * if n is even, divide it by 2
 * else multiply n by 3 and add 1
until it the result of the permutations is 1.

My solution is straightoward, with the exception of a little speed-boost when crunching larger numbers: if the seed number is a power of 2, skip it, because it will never be the longest sequence (any power of 2 will always satify the `if even` condition, and the sequence will reduce straight to 1.);
