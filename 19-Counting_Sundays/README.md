# 19. Counting Sundays

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (Jan 1st, 1901 to Dec 31st 2000)?

There are mathematical ways of Solving this problem through calculating the even distribution of weekdays.  I was more interested in trying my hand at writing a module that would calculate the day of the week for any given day after Jan 1st, 1900.
